        <h2>Here's a biography of Jordan Petersons life</h2>
        <p>
          Jordan Bernt Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian clinical
          psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of
          Toronto. He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s
          for his views on cultural and political issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in
          political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a
          PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and
          research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to join
          the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he
          published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief,
          which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book
          combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature,
          philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the
          Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill
          C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce "gender
          identity and expression" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He
          argued that the bill would make the use of certain gender pronouns
          into compelled speech, and related this argument to a general critique
          of political correctness and identity politics. He subsequently
          received significant media coverage, attracting both support and
          criticism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peterson's lectures and debates—propagated also through podcasts and
          YouTube—gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical
          practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his
          second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a
          world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries
